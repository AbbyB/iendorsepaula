_Make your own supporter graphic for [Charles Booker](https://bookerforkentucky.com/) to share on social media!_

## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and used [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) to generate endorsement images.

If you are deploying a branch of this, you may find yourself needing to set up a license to Adobe fonts to use the Jubilat web-font.
